      CoW Protocol supports three type of orders â€“ market, limit and liquidity:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Market order</strong>: Buy or sell at the current market&apos;s best available price
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limit order</strong>: Buy or sell at an arbitrary price specified by the user
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Liquidity order</strong>: A special order type that market makers use to provide liquidity
        </li>
      </ul>
      In addition, orders can either allow or not allow partial execution:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fill or kill</strong>: Either the order is fully filled, or not filled at all. Currently all market
          orders are fill or kill.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Partial execution</strong>: The order can be executed partially, as long as the limit price is
          respected. (This could be relevant if a price were to become available for some but not all of an order.)
