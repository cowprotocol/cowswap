<h2>What is Convex Finance (CVX)?</h2>

<p>Introducing Convex Finance (CVX), a leading DeFi protocol developed to refine and maximize yield earnings in the decentralized finance world. Simplifying the Curve boosting experience, Convex paves the way for Curve liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without needing to lock up CRV themselves. This creates a delightful balance between liquidity providers and CRV stakers, and results in higher capital efficiency. Moo! Staking CRV with Convex, users receive not only trading fees but also a share of boosted CRV given to liquidity providers, all with minimal effort. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">DeFi</a> has never been more rewarding or more efficient! </p>

<p>Notably, Convex positions itself as an influential participant in the so-called 'Curve wars'. The platform uses a unique incentive structure to accumulate as much Total Value Locked (TVL) as possible, aiming to control a significant stake of Curve Finance. Curve LPs who deposit their LP tokens into Convex can anticipate maximized CRV earnings and a highly efficient boost. A direct benefit of this is that even small-scale investors can enjoy boosted rewards that might be unattainable elsewhere. Moo-ving on up!</p>

<h2>What Makes Convex Finance Unique?</h2>

<p>What sets Convex Finance apart in the vast prairie of DeFi protocols is its central role in the Curve wars, courtesy of its unique incentive structure. Convex Finance targets only CRV holders and Curve liquidity providers in two notable ways: CRV holders receive cvxCRV for staking their CRV, and Curve LPs enjoy boosted rewards for staking their LP tokens with Convex. Moreover, CVX users can stake their CRV tokens and receive cvxCRV to enjoy several benefits, including veCRV rewards, Convex trading fees, CVX tokens, and airdrops going to veCRV token holders. It's a fruitful pasture for all its users!</p>
