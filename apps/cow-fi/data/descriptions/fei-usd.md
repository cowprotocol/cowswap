<h2>What is Fei Protocol (FEI)?</h2>
<p>Unlock the potential of DeFi with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">stablecoin</a>, Fei Protocol (FEI)! Anchoring itself in the dynamic world of decentralized finance, FEI employs a unique system known as Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). This groundbreaking mechanism enables capital efficiency, fair distribution, and complete decentralization. Simply put, FEI represents an algorithmic stablecoin that doesn't rely on centralized assets for collateral. This innovative stablecoin has been crafted by the masterminds at Fei Labs, who are backed by industry giants like a16z, Nascent, and Coinbase. Moo!</p>

<p>Fei Protocol isn't just one-dimensional; it supports two crypto assets - FEI, the stablecoin, and TRIBE, the governance token. This protocol works diligently, using its value control to ensure liquidity in secondary markets and generate yield for the protocol itself. Originally launched in December 2020, Fei Protocol captured the crypto community's attention, resulting in a remarkable $19 million VC investment by early March 2021. While there were initial pegging issues, proactive governance upgrades enabled the protocol to regain stability.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Fei Protocol is far from complacent. At the helm of Fei Protocol, we find Joey Santoro, Brianna Montgomery, and Sebastian Delgado - a team with extensive backgrounds in software engineering, business management, and blockchain. Their united vision and diligent work have played pivotal roles in Fei Protocol's evolution. But, they aren't alone. So, hold on tight; the stablecoin space is due for a bovine-style shakeup!</p>
