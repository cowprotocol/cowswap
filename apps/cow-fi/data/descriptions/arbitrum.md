<h2>What is Arbitrum (ARB)?</h2>
<p>Welcome to the world of Arbitrum (ARB), an Ethereum-based Layer 2 scaling solution thatâ€™s as solid and dependable as a robust cow in the field. Designed to offer users fast, scalable, and cost-efficient transactions, Arbitrum uses a mechanism called <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Optimistic Rollups</a> to lighten the load on the Ethereum network. Moo-ving most of the computation and storage off-chain allows Arbitrum to offer higher throughput and lower fees, while keeping the security and compatibility benefits of the Ethereum mainchain. Some of the biggest decentralized applications (dApps) already enjoy these benefits on Arbitrum, including GMX, Radiant, Uniswap V3, and Gains Network.</p>

<p>The native token of Arbitrum, ARB, is not just another milk jug in the barn; it's a central part of the project's governance structure. Developers Offchain Labs have recently shifted to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)</a> structure, the Arbitrum DAO, and ARB token holders can vote on key proposals. These include protocol upgrades, funds allocation, and even electing a Security Council. It's like a town meeting, but for your digital wallet! On top of this, an ambitious roadmap lies ahead for Arbitrum in 2023, which includes the launch of its own Layer 3 solution called Orbit and broadening its validator set to incorporate more independent institutional validators.</p>

<p>Founded by the tech-savvy team at Offchain Labs, including former Princeton University researchers Ed Felten, Steven Goldfeder, and Harry Kalodner, Arbitrum has a clear vision for its future. In March 2023, they announced an airdrop of ARB to early users and DAOs building on Arbitrum, creating a buzz of excitement in the crypto community. With 12.75% of the total supply distributed based on user interaction with the Arbitrum network, the event reaffirmed Arbitrum's commitment to reward and involve its community in its development.</p>
