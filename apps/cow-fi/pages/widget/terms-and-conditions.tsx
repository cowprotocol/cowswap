          <h3>Mediation and Arbitration</h3>
          <p>
            In the event a Dispute cannot be resolved amicably, you must first refer the Dispute to proceedings under
            the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by
            reference into this clause. The place of mediation shall be London, United Kingdom. The language of the
            mediation proceedings shall be English.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the Dispute has not been settled pursuant to the ICC Mediation Rules within forty (40) days following the
            filing of a Request for Mediation in accordance with the ICC Mediation Rules or within such other period as
            the parties to the Dispute may agree in writing, such Dispute shall thereafter be finally settled under the
            Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three (3) arbitrators appointed in
            accordance with the said Rules. The seat of Arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom. The governing law
            of this arbitration clause shall be the laws of England and Wales. The language of the arbitration shall be
            English. The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions shall not apply.
          </p>
          <h3>Final Jurisdiction</h3>
          <p>
            If the Dispute cannot be resolved for legal reasons in accordance with the procedures described above, you
            and we agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the Dispute.
          </p>
          <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
          <h3>Entire agreement</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between us and you regarding its subject matter,
            and supersede and replace any previous or contemporaneous written or oral contract, promises, assurances,
            assurances, warranty, representation or understanding regarding its subject matter, whether written or oral.
            You shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or misstatement based on any statement
            in these Terms, though nothing in this clause shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud.
          </p>
          <h3>No waiver and no assignment</h3>
          <p>
            You may not assign, transfer or delegate any of your rights or duties arising out of or in connection with
            these Terms to a third party. Any such assignment or transfer shall be void and shall not impose any
            obligation or liability on us to the assignee or transferee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any delay or omission by us in relation to the exercise of any right granted by law or under these Terms

          </p>
          <h3>Severability</h3>
          <p>
            If any provision or part-provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall
            be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such
            modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any
            modification to or deletion of a provision or part-provision under this clause shall not affect the validity
            and enforceability of the rest of these Terms.
          </p>
          <h3>Governing law</h3>
          <p>
