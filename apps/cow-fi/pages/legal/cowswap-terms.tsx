              <p>
                Interacting with the Interface such as submitting orders to exchange compatible tokens involves
                significant risks of loss. You could lose all or more of your capital.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tokensâ€™ value is highly volatile causing price fluctuations, as auctions typically run for some time
                and trades are not executed instantly.

                financial professional before making any investment decisions.

                Please be aware that all transactions on public blockchains are permanently recorded and publicly

                your privacy is not guaranteed. If you require anonymity or confidentiality for your transactions,

                CoW Protocol (the &quot;Protocol&quot;) is a decentralized protocol owned and operated by CoW DAO that
                allows users to trade certain digital assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                CoW Protocol is a set of smart contracts that applies batch auction mechanisms to allow peer-to-peer
                trades on well-established networks such as Ethereum and Gnosis Chain and emerging solutions within
                Ethereum layer 2 solutions. CoW DAO is not custodian or counterparty to any transactions executed by you
                on the Protocol. We do not support any other service, particularly we do not provide any order matching,
