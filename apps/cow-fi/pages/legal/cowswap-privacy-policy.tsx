                This Policy sets out what Personal Data we collect, how we process it and how long we retain it. This

                In this Policy, “personal data” means any information relating to you as an identified or identifiable

                or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online identifier or to
                one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or
                social identity.

                In this Policy, “processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal
                data (as defined in this Privacy Policy) or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means,

              <h2 id="1-your-information-and-the-blockchain">1. Your information and the Blockchain</h2>
              <p>
                Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply ‘DLT’), is at the core of
                the business of our clients. Blockchains are decentralised and made up of digitally recorded data in a
                chain of packages called ‘blocks’. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning
                that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the
                world (across several ‘nodes’ which usually replicate the ledger), this means there is no single person
                making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing
                system), and that there is no centralised place where it is located either.
              </p>
              <p>
                Accordingly, by design, a blockchains records cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be
                ‘immutable’. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (‘right
                to be forgotten’), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data. Data on the
                blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke
                certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.
              </p>
              <p>
                In certain circumstances, it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your wallet
                address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such
                transactions using your wallet’s private key.
              </p>
              <p>
                In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the blockchain using your wallet address, as well as
                (ii) share the public key relating to your wallet address with anyone (including us) rests with you.
              </p>
              <p className={'warn'}>
                IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON
                BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE
                TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC
                AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

                We may pass your information to our clients, Business Partners, administration centres, third party
                service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organisations for the purposes of
                completing tasks and providing our services to you.

              <p>
                In addition, when we use any other third-party service providers, we will disclose only the personal
                information that is necessary to deliver the service required and we will ensure that they keep your
                information secure and not use it for their own direct marketing purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, we may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of some, or
                all, of our business and assets or as part of any business restructuring or reorganisation, or if we are
                under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation.

                We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
                lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to
                your personal data to those employees (if applicable), agents, contractors and other third parties who
                have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are
                subject to a duty of confidentiality. Please note that intents to trade are publicly accessible via the
                API/Explorer, SDK and may be stored on the Blockchain as per applicable paragraphs above.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and

                    it to us, information as to the source) and this Privacy Policy intends to provide the information.

                    want us to use your Personal Information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy, or need to

                    You have the general right to request the erasure of your personal information in the following

                    <li>
                      You withdraw your consent to consent-based processing and no other legal justification for
                      processing applies;

                    <li>Erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.</li>

                  <p className={'warn'}>
                    However, when interacting with the blockchain we may not be able to ensure that your personal data
                    is deleted. This is because the blockchain is a public decentralised network and blockchain
                    technology does not generally allow for data to be deleted and your right to erasure may not be able
                    to be fully enforced. In these circumstances we will only be able to ensure that all personal data
                    that is held by us is permanently deleted.

                  <p>
                    We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is
