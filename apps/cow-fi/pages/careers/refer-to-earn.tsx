                <li>

                </li>
                <li>Referrers should not directly submit Candidate information to CoW.</li>

                  The Referrer becomes eligible to receive the full referral bonus of five thousand USDC or USD (6,000)
                  after three (3) months from the Candidate&apos;s start date, provided that the Candidate remains
                  providing services to CoW during this period. The Referrer can decide if they want to be paid in USDC

                <li>
                  The referral bonus is excl. VAT (VAT can be added), but net of any other tax, such as, income tax or

                </li>
                <li>
                  The referral bonus will be paid to the Referrer within thirty (30) days receiving a legally compliant

                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Miscellaneous Rules</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Contracting to CoW includes a number of routes, including EORs. Grants (other than core contributors)
                  are not counted into these routes and Grant recipients are eligible to make referrals.
                </li>
                <li>The decision regarding the Candidate&apos;s submission order is based solely on our judgment.</li>
                <li>
                  We can terminate this program at any point in time and at our sole discretion, without notice. Of
                  course, presently referred Candidates remain part of the program.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The conditions of the referral program will be shared via email with the Referrer, and we will require
                  confirmation by responding to the email once a Candidate accepts a Job Offer. Unfortunately, the
                  Referrer will not qualify for a bonus if we do not receive this confirmation.
                </li>
