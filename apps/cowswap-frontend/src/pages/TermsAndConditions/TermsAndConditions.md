## Important prior warnings

### Financial risks

Interacting with the Interface such as submitting orders to exchange compatible tokens involves significant risks of loss. You could lose all or more of your capital.

The tokens’ value is highly volatile causing price fluctuations, as auctions typically run for some time and trades are not executed instantly.

Please carefully consider your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and experience before engaging in any trading activities. This is not financial advice, and you should always consult with a qualified financial professional before making any investment decisions.


### Beware of scammers

We will never contact you first, never ask you for password, private keys, seed phrase, nor ask you to connect your wallet to a third party decentralised application.


### Technical understanding

Cryptographic assets are described in technical language requiring a comprehensive understanding of computer science and mathematics to appreciate the inherent risks.


### Transactions on public blockchains are publicly accessible

Please be aware that all transactions on public blockchains are permanently recorded and publicly accessible. This means anyone can view the details of your transactions, including the amount, sender, and receiver addresses. While this transparency offers benefits like security and trust, it also means your privacy is not guaranteed. If you require anonymity or confidentiality for your transactions, please consider using a different platform.


### Transactions on public blockchains are immutable and irreversible

Transactions on public blockchains are generally immutable and irreversible. Any transaction thereon is therefore irrevocable and final as soon as it is settled thereon. In the event that you send your tokens to sell to any other destination other than the Protocol smart contracts, such tokens may not be returned. We assume no responsibility and shall have no obligation to you if this occurs, including but not limited to any responsibility to recover, or assist to recover, any such tokens.


## Please read these Terms carefully before using the Website or the Products.

### Acceptance of these Terms

By accessing the Website and/or by using our Products, you confirm that you accept these Terms and agree to comply with them. If you do not agree, you must not use the Products and leave the Website. If you think that there is an error in these Terms, please contact us at <legal@cow.fi>.

You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website or the Products through your internet connection or device are aware of these Terms and that they comply with them.

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Website or the Products immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any clause of the Terms. Upon termination of your access, your right to access the website or use the Products will immediately cease.


### Change of these Terms

We may amend these Terms at our sole discretion. We regularly do so. Every time you wish to access the Website or use the Products, please check these Terms to ensure you understand the terms that apply at that time.


## CoW Protocol

Cow Protocol (the “Protocol”) is a decentralised protocol operated by CoW DAO on the Ethereum and Gnosis Chain blockchains (and potentially any EVM compatible chains) that allows users to trade certain digital assets. The Protocol is a set of smart contracts owned by CoW DAO.

CoW Protocol applies batch auction mechanisms to allow peer-to-peer trades on Ethereum Mainnet, and Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms. CoW DAO is not custodians or counterparties to any transactions executed by you on the Protocol. We do not support any other service, particularly we do not provide any order matching, guaranteed prices, or similar exchange or trading platform services.

Please consult our [documentation](https://docs.cow.fi/cow-protocol) for more information on CoW Protocol.


## The Interface

[https://swap.cow.fi](https://swap.cow.fi/) is a web-hosted user interface (the “Interface”) providing access to CoW Protocol. You may submit orders into the Interface and exchange compatible tokens using the unique features of the Protocol.

Please consult our [documentation](https://docs.cow.fi/cow-protocol/tutorials/cow-swap) for more information on our Interface.

The features of the Interface can also be accessed through third parties’ websites integrating our widget (the “Widget”).

### Requirements to Use the Interface

To use the Interface, you must employ a non-custodial wallet application, enabling interaction with EVM compatible public blockchains. Your connection with the non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable service terms of such a third party wallet provider. We do not hold custody of your wallet's contents and are unable to recover or transfer such content. By connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.

### Non-Custody and Wallet Security

The Interface operates as a non-custodial application, which implies that we, at no point in time, assume custody, ownership, or control over your digital assets.

This further underscores your unequivocal responsibility for safeguarding the cryptographic private keys associated with your digital asset wallets. Under no circumstances should you disclose your wallet credentials or seed phrase to any third party. We disclaim any responsibility or liability whatsoever in connection with your utilization of a wallet, and we make no representations or warranties regarding the compatibility of the Interface with any particular wallet.
