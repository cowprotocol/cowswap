# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: November 2022**

This Policy sets out what Personal Data we collect, how we process it and how long we retain it. This Policy applies to all of our processing activities where we act as a data controller or where we act as data controller on behalf of clients. In this policy, “we”, “us” and “our” refers to Nomev Labs, Lda and affiliates. For more information about us, see the “Our Details” section at the end of this policy.

In this Policy, “personal data” means any information relating to you as an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

In this Policy, “processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data (as defined in this Privacy Policy) or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

## 1. Your information and the Blockchain

Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply ‘DLT’), is at the core of the business of our clients. Blockchains are decentralised and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called ‘blocks’. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several ‘nodes’ which usually replicate the ledger), this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralised place where it is located either.

Accordingly, by design, a blockchains records cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be ‘immutable’. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.

In certain circumstances, it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your wallet’s private key.

In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the blockchain using your wallet address, as well as (ii) share the public key relating to your wallet address with anyone (including us) rests with you.

_IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE_

## 6. Your Rights as a Data Subject

You have certain rights under applicable legislation, and in particular under Regulation EU 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or ‘GDPR’). We explain these below. You can find out more about the GDPR and your rights by accessing the European Commission’s website.

- ### Right Information and access

  You have a right to be informed about the processing of your personal data (and if you did not give it to us, information as to the source) and this Privacy Policy intends to provide the information. Of course, if you have any further questions you can contact us on the below details.

- ### Right to rectification

  You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified and to have any incomplete personal information about you completed. You may also request that we restrict the processing of that information. The accuracy of your information is important to us. If you do not want us to use your Personal Information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy, or need to advise us of any changes to your personal information, or would like any more information about the way in which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us at the above details.

- ### Right to erasure (right to be ‘forgotten’)

  You have the general right to request the erasure of your personal information in the following circumstances:

  - the personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected;
  - you withdraw your consent to consent based processing and no other legal justification for processing applies;
  - you object to processing for direct marketing purposes;
  - we unlawfully processed your personal information; and
  - erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.

  _However, when interacting with the blockchain we may not be able to ensure that your personal data is deleted. This is because the blockchain is a public decentralised network and blockchain technology does not generally allow for data to be deleted and your right to erasure may not be able to be fully enforced. In these circumstances we will only be able to ensure that all personal data that is held by us is permanently deleted._

  We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is necessary for:

  - Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
  - Complying with a legal obligation under EU or other applicable law;
  - The performance of a task carried out in the public interest;
  - Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, under certain circumstances; and/or
  - The establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.

  You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us on the below details.

- ### Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing

  You have a right to restrict processing of your personal information, such as where:

  - you contest the accuracy of the personal information;
  - where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of the unlawfully processed personal information;
  - we no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.

  You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the services we can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.

- ### Right to data portability

  Where the legal basis for our processing is your consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, you have a right to receive the personal information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or ask us to send it to another person.

- ### Right to freedom from automated decision-making

  We do not use automated decision-making, but where any automated decision-making takes place, you have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision, as well as request that decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based on your personal data are made by natural persons, not only by computers.

- ### Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)

  You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless:

  You have a business relationship with us or one of our clients, and we rely on our legitimate interests or that of our clients as the lawful basis for processing (as described above) you have otherwise given your prior consent.

  You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us. On each and every marketing communication, we will always provide the option for you to exercise your right to object to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes (known as ‘opting-out’) by clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ button on our marketing emails or choosing a similar opt-out option on any forms we use to collect your data. You may also opt-out at any time by contacting us on the below details. Please note that any administrative or service-related communications (to offer our services, or notify you of an update to this Privacy Policy or applicable terms of business, etc.) will solely be directed at our clients or business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the services requested. Therefore, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our website or websites we host on behalf of clients or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.

- ### Right to request access

  You also have a right to access information we hold about you. We are happy to provide you with details of your Personal Information that we hold or process. To protect your personal information, we follow set storage and disclosure procedures, which mean that we will require proof of identity from you prior to disclosing such information. You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us on the below details.

- ### Right to withdraw consent

  Where the legal basis for processing your personal information is your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us on the below details.

- ### Raising a complaint about how we have handled your personal data
