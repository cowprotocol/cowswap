   * Since Cow Protocol supports buying trade type
   * Sometimes we need a maximum amount to sell
   *
   * How it works:
   * You want to buy exactly 2 WETH for <some amount> of COW.
   * In this case, you will input 2 WETH in the buy input
   * and the sell input will be automatically filled by the quote API response, for example with the value 552 COW.
   * Since the market is liquid, there might be a slippage, let's assume it's 2%.
   * So, the final sell amount will be 552 COW + 2% = 563.04
