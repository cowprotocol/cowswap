      This hook allows you to withdraw rewards from your Gnosis Chain validators
      through CowSwap. It automates the process of interacting with the Gnosis
      Deposit Contract, enabling you to claim any available rewards directly to
      your specified withdrawal address.
      <br />
      <br />
      The hook monitors your validator's accrued rewards and triggers the
      claimWithdrawals function when rewards are ready for withdrawal. This
      simplifies the management of Gnosis validator earnings without requiring
      ready for withdrawal. This simplifies the management of Gnosis validator
      earnings without requiring manual contract interaction, providing a
      smoother and more efficient experience for users.
