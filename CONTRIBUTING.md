<!-- # Translations
TODO: read and re-enable
Help CowSwap reach a global audience!

CowSwap uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/cowswap)
for managing translations. Whenever a new string is added to the project,
it gets uploaded to Crowdin for translation by [this workflow](./.github/workflows/crowdin.yaml).

You can contribute by joining Crowdin to proofread existing translations [here](https://crowdin.com/project/uniswap-interface/invite?d=93i5n413q403t4g473p443o4c3t2g3s21343u2c3n403l4b3v2735353i4g4k4l4g453j4g4o4j4e4k4b323l4a3h463s4g453q443m4e3t2b303s2a35353l403o443v293e303k4g4n4r4g483i4g4r4j4e4o473i5n4a3t463t4o4)

Or, ask to join us as a translator in the Discord!
