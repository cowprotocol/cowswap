<h1>Terms & Conditions<h1>

<b>Last updated: November 2022</b>

<b>Welcome to https://cow.fi/, a website-hosted user interface (the "Interface") provided by Nomev Labs, Lda. ("we", "our", or "us") on behalf of and as instructed by CoW DAO. The Interface provides access to the CoW Protocol, a decentralised protocol on the Ethereum and Gnosis Chain blockchains (all EVM compatible chains) that allows users to trade certain digital assets ("the Protocol"). The Interface is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.</b>

<b>Please read these Terms carefully before using the Interface. By using the Interface, you confirm that you accept these Terms and agree to comply with them. If you do not agree, you must not use the Interface. If you think that there is an error in these Terms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@nomev.io">legal@nomev.io</a></b>

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS (“TERMS”)**

**1. WHAT IS COW AND HOW TO CONTACT COW DAO**

1. CoW Protocol (the “Protocol”) is operated by CoW DAO, which is an Ethereum and Gnosis Chain based collective managed by community members in accordance with the CoW DAO’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">participation agreement</a> (cf. “terms”). To contact CoW DAO please use the forum at <a href="https://forum.cow.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://forum.cow.fi/</a>.
2. CoW DAO uses open source products and developer materials from third parties to service the Protocol.
3. The Protocol was originally developed by Gnosis. The Protocol is a set of smart contracts owned by CoW DAO. The Protocol applies batch auction mechanisms to allow peer-to-peer trades on Ethereum Mainnet, and Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms. Neither CoW DAO nor Nomev Labs, Lda. are custodians or counterparties to any transactions executed by you on the Protocol. We do not support any other service, particularly we do not provide any order matching, guaranteed prices, or similar exchange or trading platform services.

**2. BY USING THE INTERFACE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS**

1.  These are the general terms and conditions <strong>("Terms")</strong> that apply to the use of the Interface.
2.  By using the Interface, you confirm that you (1) accept and agree to these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you do not agree, you must not use the Interface.
3.  You are responsible for ensuring that all persons who access or use the Interface through your device or internet connection are aware of these Terms, and that they comply with them.
4.  We may amend these Terms at our sole discretion. We regularly do so. Every time you wish to use the Interface, please check these Terms to ensure you understand the terms that apply at that time.
5.  We may terminate or suspend your access to the Interface immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any clause of the Terms. Upon termination of your access, your right to use the Interface will immediately cease. Clauses 7 to 22 and any other term intended so will survive any termination of these Terms.
6.  You may have been recommended to the Interface by a third party. We shall not be liable for any agreement or terms that may exist between you and the respective third party.

**3. WHAT YOU REQUIRE TO USE THE INTERFACE**

1.  Users may use the Interface to interact with the Protocol and buy or sell EVM compatible tokens by submitting orders into a batch auction running on the Protocol.
2.  A detailed FAQ guide on how to use the Interface may be found in the <a href="https://swap.cow.fi/#/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">“FAQ”</a> section on the Interface.
3.  To use the Interface you require:
    1.  A wallet compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain, Gnosis Chain or an Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanism, depending on which network you interact with the Protocol. We currently support EOA (Externally Owned Account) type of wallets that support <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-712-eth-signtypeddata-as-a-standard-for-machine-verifiable-and-human-readable-typed-data-signing/397" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EIP712</a> as well as certain Smart contract wallets. However, not all smart contract wallets implement the standards the same way we do and might therefore not fully support integration with the Interface.
    2.  An ERC 20 token to trade (or ETH).

**4. FEES**

We do not levy any fees on users of the Interface, however, the user incurs a fee on the Protocol level, which - if technically possible - is shown to the user on the Interface when the user places their trade intent. No fees accrue to us.

**5. WE MAY MAKE CHANGES TO OR SUSPEND OR WITHDRAW THE INTERFACE**

1.  We may update and change the Interface from time to time. The Interface is currently made available free of charge.

2.  Force Majeure shall mean any event, circumstance or cause beyond our reasonable control, which makes the provision of the Interface impossible or onerous, including, without limitation:

<a id="appendix"></a> **APPENDIX**

**RISKS**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRICE FLUCTUATIONS</span>

ERC 20 tokens as well as native ETH are neither legal tender backed by governments nor by assets. The tokens’ value is highly volatile causing price fluctuations, as auctions typically run for some time and trades are not executed instantly.

<hr>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY ACTION</span>

We could be impacted by regulatory inquiries or action, which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Interface.

<hr>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING</span>

Cryptographic assets are described in technical language requiring a comprehensive understanding of computer science and mathematics to appreciate the inherent risks.

<hr>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRANSACTIONS ON ETHEREUM MAINNET, GNOSIS CHAIN AND ETHEREUM VIRTUAL MACHINE COMPATIBLE VALIDATION MECHANISMS ARE IMMUTABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE
</span>

Transactions on Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain and Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanisms are generally immutable and irreversible. Any transaction thereon is therefore irrevocable and final as soon as it is settled thereon. In the event that you send your tokens to sell to any other destination other than the Protocol smart contracts, such tokens may not be returned. We assume no responsibility and shall have no obligation to you if this occurs, including but not limited to any responsibility to recover, or assist to recover, any such tokens.

<hr>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAILURES WITHIN DATA STORAGE SYSTEMS
</span>

The Interface may in part be established on servers at data centre facilities of third party providers and on distributed systems for storing and accessing data including IPFS. Where centralised services may be used, we may be required to transfer the Interface to different facilities, and may incur service interruption in connection with such relocation. Data centre facilities are vulnerable to force majeure events or other failures. Third party providers may suffer breaches of security and others may obtain unauthorised access to our server data. Where content is stored via distributed systems, there may be interference in content addressing, content linking, indexing and discovery. As techniques used to obtain unauthorised access change frequently and generally are not recognised until used against a target, it may not be possible to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
