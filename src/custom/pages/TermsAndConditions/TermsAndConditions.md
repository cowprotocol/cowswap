**TERMS AND CONDITIONS (“TERMS”)**

**1. WHO WE ARE AND HOW TO CONTACT US**

   1. CowSwap  is operated by GnosisDAO (”**we**” or “**us**”). We are an
      Ethereum based organisation managed by community members. To contact
      us, please write to us via the
      GnosisDAO subcategory of <a href="https://forum.gnosis.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum.gnosis.io</a>.
   2. We use open source products and developer materials from Gnosis
      Limited and affiliated persons and entities (“**Affiliates**”) as
      well as other third parties to provide a Platform to Gnosis Protocol
      version 2 (the “**Protocol**”). The provision of the Platform and
      the Protocol is based solely on our independent actions.

**2. WE PROVIDE A PLATFORM TO INTERACTING WITH THE GNOSIS PROTOCOL**

   1. We provide a graphical user interface (the “**Platform**”) to
      facilitate you interacting with the Protocol.
   2. The Protocol was developed by Gnosis Limited and is governed by
      smart contracts that allow permissionless peer-to-peer trades
      between users applying a batch auction mechanism and without the
      need for intermediaries on Ethereum Mainnet, and Ethereum Virtual
      Machine compatible validation mechanisms. We are not a custodian or
      a counterparty to any transactions executed by you on the Protocol.
      We do not support any other service, particularly we do not provide
      any order matching, guaranteed prices, or similar exchange or
      trading platform services.

<a id="appendix"></a> **APPENDIX**

**RISKS**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PRICE FLUCTUATIONS</span>

ERC 20 tokens are neither legal tender backed by governments nor by
assets. The tokens’ value is highly volatile causing price fluctuations,
as auctions typically run for some time and trades are not executed
instantly.

<hr>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY ACTION</span>

We could be impacted by regulatory inquiries or action, which could impede
or limit your ability to access or use the Platform.

<hr>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING</span>

Cryptographic assets are described in technical language requiring a
comprehensive understanding of computer science and mathematics to
appreciate the inherent risks.

<hr>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRANSACTIONS ON ETHEREUM
MAINNET AND ETHEREUM VIRTUAL MACHINE COMPATIBLE VALIDATION MECHANISMS
ARE IMMUTABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE</span>

Transactions on Ethereum Mainnet and Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible
validation mechanisms are generally immutable and irreversible. Any
transaction thereon is therefore irrevocable and final as soon as it is
settled thereon. In the event that you send your tokens to sell to any
other destination other than the Protocol smart contracts, such tokens
may not be returned. We assume no responsibility and shall have no
obligation to you if this occurs, including but not limited to any
responsibility to recover, or assist to recover, any such tokens.

<hr>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAILURES WITHIN DATA STORAGE
SYSTEMS</span>

Our Platform may in part be established on servers at data centre
facilities of third party providers and on  distributed systems for
storing and accessing data including IPFS. Where centralised services
may be used, we may be required to transfer our Platform to different
facilities, and may incur service interruption in connection with such
relocation. Data centre facilities are vulnerable to force majeure
events or other failures. Third party providers may suffer breaches of
security and others may obtain unauthorised access to our server data.
Where content is stored via distributed systems, there may be
interference in  content addressing, content linking, indexing and
discovery. As techniques used to obtain unauthorised access change
frequently and generally are not recognised until used against a target,
it may not be possible to anticipate these techniques or to implement
adequate preventive measures.
