          <h3 id="what-is-cowswap-s-fee-model">What is CowSwap’s fee model?</h3>
          <p>
            Each executed order has a fee which is captured by the protocol. Part of the fee is paid to solvers
            (entities which provide order settlement solutions) to incentivize their participation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fee consists of the &quot;base cost to execute the trade&quot; and the &quot;protocol fee&quot;
            (although it is only exposed to the user as one fee). As a user, you are only signing a message to submit
            your trade and the underlying solver will end up submitting the transaction for you. Essentially you are
            paying this &quot;base cost to execute the trade&quot;, aka &quot;gas costs&quot;, with your sell token and
            the cost is already included in your price estimation. The protocol is currently subsidizing a portion of
            the gas costs, while the protocol fee is currently switched off.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Note that you will only have to pay fees IF your trade is executed. No more gas costs on any failed
              transactions!
            </strong>

            How does CowSwap connect to all on-chain liquidity?
          </h3>
          <p>CowSwap can connect to all on-chain liquidity.</p>
          <p>
            When CowSwap does not have enough CoWs (Coincidence of Wants) among the orders available for a batch, it
            taps other AMMs’ liquidity to be able to settle the traders’ orders. CoW Protocol can be connected to any
            on-chain liquidity sources and can therefore enjoy the benefits of concentrating the fragmented liquidity
            across decentralized finance.
          </p>
          <h3 id="how-is-cowswap-able-to-offer-better-prices-than-aggregators-themselves">
            How is CowSwap able to offer better prices?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Before using on-chain liquidity, CowSwap tries to find CoWs (Coincidences of Wants) within the set of
            currently valid orders and match them directly with one another. CoWs result in better prices because no fee
            is paid to the liquidity provider (e.g., 0.3% for Uniswap v2). In the case that CowSwap does not have CoWs,
            it taps into the DEX that gives the next best price. This results in the same or better performance than
            existing DEX aggregators.
          </p>
          <h3 id="how-can-i-become-a-liquidity-provider">How can I become a liquidity provider?</h3>
          <p>
            CowSwap does not have liquidity providers. Instead, it connects to all on-chain liquidity that is provided
            across different protocols. Since orders only incur a cost if traded, active market makers can observe the
            orderbook and place counter orders (creating a CoW) to prevent settling trades via external liquidity.
          </p>
          <h3 id="wallet-not-supported">Why is my wallet not supported?</h3>
          <p>
            CowSwap uses offline signatures to offer gasless orders. Additionally, Smart Contract (SC) wallets are
            supported through an alternative signing method called{' '}
            <LinkScrollable href={'/faq/protocol#what-is-presign'}>pre-sign</LinkScrollable>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular, non Smart Contract wallets (called EOA) require the wallet to support off-chain signing (
            <ExternalLinkFaq href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712</ExternalLinkFaq> standard).
          </p>
          <p>
            Through our own internal testing and user reports, we identified some EOA wallets that do not yet work with
            off-chain signing. Thus, you might find your wallet is not supported. If that is the case for you, reach out
            to your wallet developers and ask for it.
          </p>
          <h3 id="smart-contract-support">Are Smart Contract wallets supported?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! Any Smart Contract (be it a wallet or regular contract) can trade in CowSwap by using one signing
            method called pre-sign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pre-sign is a protocol operation that can be invoked by any contract. The operation has a single parameter
            that is the &quot;orderId&quot; which identifies the order being approved. Pre-signing your order in the
            settlement contract is equivalent to providing an off-chain signature for the orderId.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the future, the protocol might provide{' '}
            <ExternalLinkFaq href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271">EIP-1271</ExternalLinkFaq> support for
            off-chain signing also for smart contracts, making gasless trading possible also for smart contracts.
          </p>

          <h3 id="what-is-presign">What is pre-sign?</h3>
          <p>
            It is an alternative way of signing orders offered by the protocol, that is especially interesting for smart
            contract integrations and Smart Contract wallets. See{' '}
            <LinkScrollable href={'/faq/protocol#smart-contract-support'}>Smart Contract support</LinkScrollable> for
            more information.

          <h3 id="what-are-gnosis-protocol-v2-solvers">What are CoW Protocol&apos;s Solvers?</h3>
          <p>
            In CoW Protocol, instead of using a central operator or a constant function market maker to determine trade
            settlements, the protocol uses a party called a &quot;solver&quot;, who is the party in charge of providing
            the settlement solution to the batch auctions. Solvers compete against each other to submit the best
            possible batch settlement solution. Each time a solver submits a successful batch settlement solution, the
            protocol rewards them with tokens, meaning that the protocol rewards solvers for solving the batch auction
            optimization problem. By meeting certain requirements, anyone can become a solver:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              To become a solver, an Ethereum address needs to deposit a bond in the form of tokens. Asset type and
              amounts are pending to be defined by the CowDAO.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the tokens have been staked (locked up), CowDAO must vote to approve or reject the Ethereum address
              that will identify the solver. If the vote is successful, the solver Ethereum address will be included in
              the allowlist (verification) solvers contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, a solver must have the technical knowledge to create the appropriate batch settlement
              solutions, or take the risk of being slashed by the CowDAO for wrongdoing.
            </li>
          </ol>
