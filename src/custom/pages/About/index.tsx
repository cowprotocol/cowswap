        <p>CowSwap is the first trading interface built on top of CoW Protocol.</p>
        <p>
          It allows you to buy and sell tokens using gas-less orders that are settled peer-to-peer among its users or
          into any on-chain liquidity source while providing MEV protection.

        <p>
          Every time you and another trader each hold an asset the other wants, your trade is settled directly without
          using an AMM (Automated Market Maker) and therefore without incurring any slippage + fees. Only amounts that
          can&apos;t be settled with other CowSwap traders are sent to the underlying AMMs.
          <br />
          <br />
          This economic phenomenon is known as <b>Coincidence Of Wants (CoW)</b>.

        <p>
          Gas costs are accounted for in your sell token already - no gas costs need to be paid! CowSwap uses an
          off-chain design for submitting trades:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>You sign a trade message which is submitted to CowSwap‚Äôs off-chain service</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>CowSwap&apos;s off-chain service optimizes your trade&apos;s execution by considering:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Coincidence Of Wants</p>
              </li>
              <li>Best execution route among AMMs (for the remaining amount)</li>
              <li>
                <p>Optimized gas price for inclusion in the next mined block</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Your trade is submitted and settled on-chain</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Why? This helps you to save on gas, slippage &amp; protocol fees. You might receive a larger amount than
          anticipated{' '}

          <img src={mevIMG} alt="CowSwap - Maximum Extractable Value" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Heard about Maximum Extractable Value yet? It&apos;s scary. To date more than{' '}
          <ExternalLink href={FLASHBOTS_LINK}>USD {MEV_TOTAL}</ExternalLink> in value has been extracted from users by
          bots frontrunning transactions, exploiting the slippage users allow in a trade.
          <br />
          <br />
          CowSwap is the first DEX Aggregator offering some protection against it: COWs enable tight slippages and can
          even avoid settlement on AMMs altogether.
