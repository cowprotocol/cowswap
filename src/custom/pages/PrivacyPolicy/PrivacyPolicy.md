#  Privacy Policy
### (updated May 2021)

 
We are delighted that you have chosen to use our App and/or visit our website. We take our data protection responsibilities with the utmost seriousness and we have designed our website so that you may navigate and use it without having to provide Personal Data.

This Policy sets out what Personal Data we collect, how we process it and how long we retain it. This Policy applies to all of our processing activities where we act as a data controller.

In this policy, "we", "us" and "our" refers to GnosisDAO. We are en Ethereum based organisation managed by community members. To contact us , please write to us at the GnosisDAO category of forum.gnosis.io.

In this Policy, “personal data” means any information relating to you as an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
In this Policy, “processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data (as defined in this Privacy Policy) or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

### 1. Your information and the Blockchain ###
Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply ‘DLT’), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralized and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called ‘blocks’. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several ‘nodes’ which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.
Accordingly, by design, a blockchains records cannot be changed or deleted and are said to be ‘immutable’. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.
In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of tokens) it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your wallet’s private key.

<span style="color: red;">IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE</span>

<span style="color: red;">When interacting with the blockchain, as explained above in this Policy, the blockchain is a global decentralized public network and accordingly any personal data written onto the blockchain may be transferred and stored across the globe.</span>

### 6. Existence of Automated Decision-making
We do not use automatic decision-making or profiling when processing Personal Data.

### 7. Data Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

### 8. Your Rights as a Data Subject
You have certain rights under applicable legislation, and in particular under Regulation EU 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or ‘GDPR’). We explain these below. You can find out more about the GDPR and your rights by accessing the [European Commission’s website](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en).

#### Right Information and access

You have a right to be informed about the processing of your personal data (and if you did not give it to us, information as to the source) and this Privacy Policy intends to provide the information. Of course, if you have any further questions you can contact us on the above details.

#### Right to rectification

* You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified and to have any incomplete personal information about you completed. You may also request that we restrict the processing of that information.
* The accuracy of your information is important to us. If you do not want us to use your Personal Information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy, or need to advise us of any changes to your personal information, or would like any more information about the way in which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us at the above details.

	#### Right to erasure (right to be ‘forgotten’)

* You have the general right to request the erasure of your personal information in the following circumstances:
	1. the personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected;
	2. you withdraw your consent to consent based processing and no other legal justification for processing applies;
	3. you object to processing for direct marketing purposes;
	4. we unlawfully processed your personal information; and
	5. erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.
* <span style="color: red;">However, when interacting with the blockchain we may not be able to ensure that your personal data is deleted. This is because the blockchain is a public decentralized network and blockchain technology does not generally allow for data to be deleted and your right to erasure may not be able to be fully enforced. In these circumstances we will only be able to ensure that all personal data that is held by us is permanently deleted.</span>
* We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is necessary for:
	1. Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
	2. Complying with a legal obligation under EU or other applicable law;
	3. The performance of a task carried out in the public interest;
	4. Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, under certain circumstances; and/or
	5. The establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.

	#### Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing

* You have a right to restrict processing of your personal information, such as where:
	1. you contest the accuracy of the personal information;
	2. where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of the unlawfully processed personal information;
	3. we no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims. 
* You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the services we can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.
* <span style="color: red;">However, when interacting with the blockchain, as it is a public decentralized network, we will likely not be able to prevent external parties from processing any personal data which has been written onto the blockchain. In these circumstances we will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure that all processing of personal data held by us is restricted, notwithstanding this, your right to restrict to processing may not be able to be fully enforced.</span>

#### Right to data portability

Where the legal basis for our processing is your consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, you have a right to receive the personal information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or ask us to send it to another person.

#### Right to freedom from automated decision-making
	
As explained above, we do not use automated decision-making, but where any automated decision-making takes place, you have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision, as well as request that decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based on your personal data are made by natural persons, not only by computers.

#### Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)

* You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us.
* We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless:
	1. you have a business relationship with us, and we rely on our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing (as described above)

* You can change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us on the above details.

* Please note that any administrative or service-related communications (to offer our services, or notify you of an update to this Privacy Policy or applicable terms of business, etc.) will solely be directed at our clients or business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the services requested. Therefore, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our website or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.

#### Right to request access

You also have a right to access information we hold about you. We are happy to provide you with details of your Personal Information that we hold or process.
