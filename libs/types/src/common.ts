/**
 * This helper type allows to define a state that is persisted by chain.
 *
 * For a lot of constants in the project we use Record<SupportedChainId, T> to model them, so when we add new chains, we will get a compile time error until we update the new value for the added chain.
 * This patter is fine for this configuration constants.
 *
 * However, we can't use the same pattern for modeling persisted state (in local storage for example).
 * The reason is that when a user recovers a persisted value from an older version where a chain didn't exist, it will return `undefined` when we try to access the value for the new chain.
 * The type won't be correct, and typescript will make us assume that the value is always defined leading to hard to debug runtime errors.
