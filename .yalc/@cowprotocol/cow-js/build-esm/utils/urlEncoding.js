// We cannot have a dash in the symbol because:
// 1. We use a `-` to separate token symbols in the URL to name the market.
//   For example "A-B", where A is the sell token and B is the buy token
// 2. Tokens can have dashes in their symbols
// 3. Even if we encode dashes to `%2D`, browsers auto convert them back to `-`
// For these reasons, we are picking a symbol that is not ambiguous with a dash
// and it has very little chance to be used as part of a token symbol.
