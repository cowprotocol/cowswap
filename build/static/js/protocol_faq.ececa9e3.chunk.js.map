This leads to better prices\n            for the individual traders (because traditionally market makers add a fee — referred to as spread — for\n            their service).\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            CoW Swap allows for coincidence of wants (CoWs) orders to be traded directly against one another. Only the\n            excess order amounts that cannot be settled directly with other CoW Swap traders are sent to the underlying\n            AMMs (automated market makers).\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 id=\"how-am-i-protected-from-mev-arbitrage-front-running-sandwiching-with-cowswap\">\n            How am I protected from MEV (Arbitrage, Front running, Sandwiching) with CoW Swap?\n          </h3>\n\n          <p>\n            CoW Swap leverages batch auctions with uniform clearing prices for all trades in the same batch. Because of\n            the uniform clearing price, there is no need for ordering the transactions within a single batch. Because\n            everyone receives the same price across assets it&apos;s not possible for <b>any</b> value to be extracted\n            by placing transactions in a certain order. This prevents the primary strategy used in MEV.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Batches are decentrally settled by external, independent parties (called “solvers”) on-chain. A solver is a\n            person or entity who submits order settlement solutions that maximize trade surplus for a given batch.\n            Solvers are incentivized to implement professional transaction management techniques that allow them to set\n            very tight slippage bounds on any interactions with external liquidity sources (e.g., trading CoW excess on\n            Uniswap). This dramatically reduces the manipulation surface of miners and front-runners.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Additionally, depending on the composition of the orders that are submitted and are valid for a given batch,\n            the existence of CoWs may significantly reduce the amount that has to be exchanged via external MEV-prone\n            protocols, such as Uniswap.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 id=\"how-does-cowswap-determine-prices\">How does CoW Swap determine prices?</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            CoW Swap settles batch auctions in discrete time intervals. In the absence of other traders, CoW Swap\n            matches traders against the best available on-chain liquidity (note: currently the solvers have integrated\n            liquidity from Uni v2, Uni v3, Balancer, Balancer v2, Sushiswap and the liquidity that Aggregators such as\n            Paraswap, Matcha and 1inch leverage).\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            If CoWs (Coincidence of Wants) orders exist in a batch, the “smaller” order is matched fully with the larger\n            order. The excess of the larger order is settled with the best available base liquidity CoW Swap integrates\n            with, which is, for now, Uniswap. The clearing price for both orders will be the price of the token with the\n            excess amount on external liquidity sources to which the protocol is connected.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Finding the best settlement for orders is a challenging task, which very soon may have its own{' '}\n            <ExternalLinkFaq href={GNOSIS_FORUM_ROADTODECENT_LINK}>decentralized competition</ExternalLinkFaq>.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3 id=\"is-cowswap-secure-to-use\">Is CoW Swap secure to use?</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            As of August 11th, 2021, CoW Swap is no longer in alpha and moves to a final, stable version.

CoWs result in better prices because no fee\n            is paid to the liquidity provider (e.g., 0.3% for Uniswap v2). In the case that CoW Swap does not have CoWs,\n            it taps into the DEX that gives the next best price.

Solvers compete against each other to submit the best\n            possible batch settlement solution.
